        I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
        interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My
        favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,
        creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built
        for performance and usability.

        accessibility. I contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI
        components that power Klaviyo’s frontend, ensuring our platform meets

        In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a
        variety of settings — from advertising agencies and large corporations
        to start-ups and small digital product studios. Additionally, I also
        released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding learners
        through building a web app with the Spotify API.
